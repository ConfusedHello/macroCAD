# MacroCAD
My own macropad made for CAD! Made for Hackclub's Highway/Hackpad event.

For this macropad, there is a function row at the bottom to switch "layers", ie. extra buttons!!


## The PCB
The PCB was designed entirely in KiCad. Here's an image of the schematic.

## The Case
First time using Fusion360! Went pretty well actually. Here's what we went with.

Started off by deciding on some dimensions

And moved onto creating a sketch

Then a bit more work later, the final case
